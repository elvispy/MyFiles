//JavaScript
//normal for loops are identical to the for loops in c++

for(let myvar = 0; myvar < 12; myvar++)
{
  console.log(myvar);
}

//we also have list comprehension inside for loopss


//the while loops are identical, also
let myal = 1;
while(myal > -10){
  myal--;
  console.log(myal);

}

//also the old friend do while expression
let i = 0;
do{
  i++
}while ( i < 12);
