//This is a Comment
//I will explain the vartypes in JS
//First, we can use three reserved words to define variables: const, var, let
//They differ in the scope of the variable
var elvis = 0; //end lines with semicolon, even though is not mandatory
let lol = 'Elvis'; //simple quotes are allowed
const myVar = "Juanito"; //strong quotes as well
let mymy = false; //false and true similar to c++

console.log(typeof mymy);

//there are other data types in JavaScript
var cmamo; //not defined variables are of undefined types
console.log(cmamo);

let zero = 1/0; //there is an infinity type.
console.log(zero);
var hehe = NaN; //not a number data type
console.log(hehe);
