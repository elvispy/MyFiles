Description: This tool provides a simple interface to LIBSVM, a library for support vector
 machines (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm). It is very easy to use as
 the usage and the way of specifying parameters are the same as that of LIBSVM.
 
 This tool provides  also a simple interface to LIBLINEAR, a library for
 large-scale regularized linear classification
 (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear).  It is very easy to use as the
 usage and the way of specifying parameters are the same as that of LIBLINEAR.
 
 This Toolbox is compatible with the NaN-toolbox!

 This interface was initially written by Jun-Cheng Chen, Kuan-Jen Peng,
 Chih-Yuan Yang and Chih-Huai Cheng from Department of Computer
 Science, National Taiwan University. 
 
 It was converted to Scilab 5.3 by Holger Nahrstaedt from TU Berlin.
