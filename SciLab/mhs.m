% find the maginal Hilbert Spectrum
function [A F] = mhs(HS,freq,flag,fres,fs)
%-------------------------------JDSA---------------------------------------
% A is the sum of the contribution of each frequency component in the freq
% vector for all time points.
% 
% F is the vector with the frequency axis, use it as x axis to plot the mhs
% 
% HS is the gilbert spectrum amplitudes, one imf per coulmn
%
% freq is the instantaneous frequency, one instantaneous frequency per
% column
%
% Flag (1 or 0) flag=1 is used to quantize the values of the instantaneous 
% frequency, then values inside a unit of the resolution ar counted as as
% the same frequency. for instance if you have 2 frequencies 10,34 and 
% 10,45 and the resolution is .25, those 2 frequencies are counted each one
% as 10,5 and the mhs sum the amplitude related to each frequency as if 
% they belong to the same frequency value, this produce smooted graphs
% fs is the sample rate of the original signal.
% flag = 0 dont quantize the vectors of instantaneous frequency

%NOTE:TAKE ON COUNT THAT THE FREQUENCY AXIS IS NOT EQUALLY ESPACED, FROM
%THE INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY SOME VALUES OF F ARE NEVER REACHED, THE IF CAN
%CHANGE FOR INSTANCE FROM 12.5 TO 14.5 AND 13 AND 13.5 DO NOT APPEAR AS 
%HAVING 0 (ZERO) CONTRIBUTION
