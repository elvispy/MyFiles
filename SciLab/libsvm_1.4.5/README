This tool provides a simple interface to LIBSVM, a library for support vector
machines (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm).
It is very easy to use as
the usage and the way of specifying parameters are the same as that of LIBSVM.


Additional Information
======================

This interface was initially written by Jun-Cheng Chen, Kuan-Jen Peng,
Chih-Yuan Yang and Chih-Huai Cheng from Department of Computer
Science, National Taiwan University. 

It was converted to Scilab 5.3 by Holger Nahrstaedt from TU Berlin.
